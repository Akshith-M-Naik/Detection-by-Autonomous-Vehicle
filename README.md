# üêæ Autonomous Vehicle Guardian: Real-Time Animal and Child Detection System

**An advanced, real-time detection system designed to make our roads safer for their most vulnerable users: children and animals. This project leverages the power of TensorFlow.js to provide immediate visual alerts and safety recommendations for autonomous and human-driven vehicles.**

## üåü Key Features

- **Real-Time Object Detection**: Utilizes the COCO-SSD model with TensorFlow.js to identify animals and people in real-time from a live camera feed, video, or static image.
- **Dynamic Risk Assessment**: Intelligently assesses the risk level based on the number and confidence of detections, as well as the type of road (normal or curved).
- **Instantaneous Alerts**: Generates immediate, easy-to-understand visual warnings when a potential hazard is detected.
- **Adaptive Speed Recommendations**: Calculates and suggests a safe driving speed based on real-time road conditions and detected objects.
- **Performance Metrics**: Provides a detailed dashboard with key performance indicators like detection time, response time, and a list of all detected objects.
- **Multiple Input Sources**: Seamlessly switch between using a live webcam, pre-recorded video files, or even static images for maximum flexibility.
- **Interactive Visualization**: Overlays bounding boxes and detection confidence scores directly onto the video feed for clear and intuitive feedback.

## üîß How It Works

The system follows a sophisticated pipeline to ensure rapid and accurate threat detection and response:

1.  **Media Input**: The user can choose to provide input via a live webcam feed, a video file, or an image. The `MediaInputService` handles the streaming and processing of the selected media.

2.  **Object Detection**: The core of the system is the `DetectionService`, which loads the pre-trained COCO-SSD model. For each frame of the input, it detects objects and filters them to a predefined list of target classes (e.g., person, dog, cat).

3.  **Risk Analysis**: The `DetectionController` takes the predictions and, in conjunction with the `AlertSystem`, assesses the risk. It considers factors such as the number of detected objects, their detection confidence, and the road type to determine if an alert is necessary.

4.  **Alert Generation**: If the risk level crosses a certain threshold, the `AlertSystem` generates a warning message. This includes a recommended safe speed, which is dynamically calculated to give the driver or autonomous system enough time to react.

5.  **Visualization and Feedback**: The `VisualizationService` is responsible for the user-facing output. It draws bounding boxes around detected objects on a canvas overlaid on the video feed. It also updates a dashboard with real-time metrics, providing a comprehensive overview of the system's performance.
